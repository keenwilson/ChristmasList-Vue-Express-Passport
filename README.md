## The Motivation for Development

As the gift-giving time of the year is approaching, we would like to help people give and get the gifts that matter most.
* **For those who love gift-giving**: Keep yourself and family happy with a home filled with thoughtful gifts
* **For consumer**: Prevent impulse buys and overspending when there are big sales everywhere
* **For the Holiday Spirit**: Take agains buying for the sake of buying

## Product features

![Homepage](./screenshots/christmaslist-welcomepage.png)
* **Christmas List** is a single page application that allows the user to create a list of gifts they wish to receive.

![Registration](./screenshots/christmaslist-register-validation.png)
* The user can register their `username`, `email address`, and `password` following these validation rules:
    * `Username` must be at least 3 characters in length and not greater than 30 characters in length.
    * `Username` must contain only letters and numbers. No special characters.
    * `Password` must contain ONLY the following characters: lower case, upper case, numerics.
    * `Password` must be at least 8 characters in length and not greater than 32 characters in length.
* If the account is created, the user can log in to their Christmas list. Once logged in, the app will automatically syncs its `store` data with `local storage` so it will remember the user even when the user refresh the page.
